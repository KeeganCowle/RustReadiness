# RustReadiness

A tool to evaluate if your rust server is setup and ready for the max amount of players possible. 

Its main purpose is to:
- Stop waste. So many servers are over sized for what they are doing. I am to assist server admins to squeeze out every last player on their server
- Help the admins. The poor guys are slaving away at 3 am trying to see why their fps is at 13 on their $1000 VPS. 
- Players. Make servers nicer to play on. Less lag spikes.

# Prerequisites
- python
    - make sure you have python > 3 installed on your server.
